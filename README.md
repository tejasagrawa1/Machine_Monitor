Developing an Artificial Intelligence Model to Predict Mechanical Failure Mechanisms on Electrical Motors Utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) Vibration Sensors 

Problems - 

The AnomAlert system currently in use is proprietary technology.​
The data it extracts, the reports it makes, and the methods of analysis are not owned by the client.​
As such, the client cannot tailor fit its analysis to its client's needs.​
On top of this, each reporting cycle consists of heavy timing overhead.

Solutions - 

The client proposes the use of two technologies to present an alternative to this:​
Treon Sensors in an IoT Framework constantly provide data,​
Machine learning models are built and run to continuously monitor said data with a dashboard for visualization.
With these two technologies, the client can replace the AnomAlert system and drive direct value to their clients.

Folders - 

DATA_COLLECTION - It stores the collected data from different fault scenarios as the sub-folder name suggests.

Data_Extraction -  It stores the Python files for continuous data extraction and processing.

Dashboard_FInal - It stores the python files to run the dashboard integrated with our data extraction files and our CNN model.

Machine_Learning_Models - It stores the Python notebooks for our CNN and Random Forrest model as well as the developed model and Python files to use the developed models.
